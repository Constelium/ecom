          <h5>What is a digital board and what sets it apart ?</h5>
          <p>
            A digital board displays content in a digital and interactive
            manner. It stands out for its ability to showcase NFTs from
            different blockchains, as well as real-time cryptocurrency prices.
            Each board is encased in a wooden frame handcrafted by a skilled
            cabinetmaker, thus marrying technology with traditional
            craftsmanship.
